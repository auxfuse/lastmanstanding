                    In August 2024, just six weeks after giving birth to our wonderful daughter Fiadh, my wife Yvonne was diagnosed with Stage 4
                    colorectal cancer. We started her treatment journey in Ireland after she was given a poor prognosis and told to try chemotherapy. 
                    Unfortunately, this is just an attempt to prolong her life without any hope of remission, and it hasn't really worked out so far,
                    with her condition worsening.<br>

                    We have already done two-trips over to Germany and our donation goal has changed as more trips are needed
                    for Yvonne. The support we have received to date has been incredible and we couldn't be more thankful.<br>
                    Gavin spoke on WLR FM in July of 2025, and told of the pursuit of advanced treatment abroad.<br>

                        There are currently few options for additional chemotherapy in Ireland, but after doing a lot of research and speaking with other cancer
                        patients, we have found treatments in Germany that have shown a lot of promise and potential. Some patients have experienced remission,
                        while others have seen a significant reduction in their disease and symptoms.<br>
                        This treatment however comes at a great cost, which for us alone is far out of reach financially.<br>
                        By hosting this Last Man Standing Competition, our goal is to keep Yvonne with us to see her two beautiful babies grow up so we are asking
                        for your help. This will be used to fund treatment, travel and cover costs of having to take time off work, of which we are already on a
                        reduced income.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Much love, Gavin and Yvonne ♥. Please dig deep and help keep this amazing wife, mother, and friend with us for years to come.
